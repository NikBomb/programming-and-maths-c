In this blog you will find interesting posts at the intersection of programming and mathematics. The world around us can be described using wonderful equations, but rarely they can be solved without the help of a computer.

These equations can be programmed in a small script that will solve a narrow class of problems, only when fiddling with the inputs and wasting an uncountable amount of hours. I have always been fascinated by big organic libraries, that can be applied to a variety of problems and at the same time help understanding better what is actually happening under the hood. 

My passion for numerical methods started while studying for my DPhil [thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:a2b5e067-ebfe-4c0f-b07e-840a6a4064de), where I built a framework to run complex simulations of dynamic events blending different temporal and spatial scales. Later I transitioned into Software Engineering where I honed my skills in programming and developed a passion for elegant and clean coding solutions. What prompted me to start this blog is the desire to share these passions and learn together. 

Feel free to reach out, I am always happy to connect with fellow engineers and/or mathematicians.
